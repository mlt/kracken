* About

This is a copy of [[http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/CLONE/KRACKEN/krackenhelp.html][KRACKEN Fortran module]] for arguments parsing with
[[http://www.cmake.org/][CMake]] bells & whistles added.

* Usage

In your CMake project include the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
find_package(KRACKEN QUIET)
if(KRACKEN_DIR)
  include_directories(${KRACKEN_DIR})
  add_executable(MyProject some_source.f90)
  target_link_libraries(MyProject kracken)
else()
  message("Download and build KRACKEN to build this project, then reconfigure this project.")
endif()
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may want to modify the above example for your needs according to
[[http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.10/cmake.html#command:find_package][CMake manual]], e.g. by strictly requiring KRACKEN. Note that KRACKEN
must be built already for the magic to happen.
